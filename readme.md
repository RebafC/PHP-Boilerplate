## PHP Boilerplate

This is meant as a shell for a new PHP project. It includes some directories and files.

The composer.json includes some basic tools, but may require additional tools for medium to large projects.
Some possible tools include (in no particular order):
- https://github.com/Behat/Behat
- https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle
- https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache (sometimes refered to as phpfastcache/phpfastcache)
- https://github.com/lavary/crunz
- https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
- https://github.com/cakephp/phinx (aka robmorgan/phinx)
- https://github.com/dragonmantank/cron-expression (or mtdowling/cron-expression)
- squizlabs/php_codesniffer
- slevomat/coding-standard
- phpstan/phpstan

The default style is provided by https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/ but there are others including:
- https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css
- https://bulma.io/

Yes this boilerplate is opinionated, but it works for me. Some of the ideas are in general use so ideas here
may be similar to those you find in other starter PHP repositories.
